## Setting Up Pre-commit and Git Hooks

This project uses `pre-commit` to manage Git hooks. To set up these hooks on your local machine:

1. Install `pre-commit`. It requires Python and can be installed via pip:
```commandline
pip install pre-commit
```
2. Install the Git hook scripts:
```commandline
pre-commit install
```
3. Optionally, run `pre-commit` against all the files to ensure everything is formatted properly:
```commandline
pre-commit run --all-files
```
By following these steps, `pre-commit` will automatically run the configured hooks on every commit.
4. Setting git hooks on your local:
```commandline
bash install_hooks.sh
```
